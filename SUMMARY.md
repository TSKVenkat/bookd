# Interactive Seat Map Implementation Summary

We've successfully implemented a comprehensive interactive seat map system for the Bookd application, allowing event organizers to create and manage complex venue layouts with advanced features.

## Key Components Created:

1. **EnhancedVenueLayoutEditor**: Main container component for the editor experience
2. **InteractiveSeatMap**: Canvas manager with zoom/pan functionality
3. **InteractiveSeat**: Individual seat renderer with interactions
4. **InteractiveSection**: Section renderer for rectangular and arc sections
5. **ArcSectionEditor**: Specialized editor for curved seating arrangements
6. **TicketTypeManager**: Interface for ticket type management
7. **DrawTools**: Tools for creating new seats and sections

## Custom Hooks:

1. **useZoomAndPan**: For canvas navigation
2. **useSeatMapKeyboard**: For keyboard shortcuts and accessibility

## Database Integration:

We've added new models to the Prisma schema:
- **SeatMap**: For storing layout configuration
- **Section**: For storing section data
- **Seat**: For storing seat data with ticket type associations

## API Endpoints:

1. **GET /api/organizer/events/[eventId]/seatmap**: Retrieves seat map data
2. **POST /api/organizer/events/[eventId]/seatmap**: Creates or updates seat map

## Advanced Features:

- Dynamic drawing of seats and sections
- Support for both rectangular and curved (arc) seating layouts
- Zoom and pan capabilities for large venues
- Automatic seat generation with consistent labeling
- Ticket type integration with visual color coding
- Keyboard controls and accessibility features

## Usage:

The new system can be used by integrating the `EnhancedVenueLayoutEditor` component into event management pages, passing the event ID, any existing layout data, and available ticket types.

```tsx
<EnhancedVenueLayoutEditor
  eventId={eventId}
  initialLayout={seatmapData}
  ticketTypes={ticketTypesData}
/>
```

## Next Steps:

1. Conduct thorough testing with various venue layouts and ticket configurations
2. Address any edge cases in the layout calculations or seat generation
3. Add more visualization options for different venue types
4. Consider implementing undo/redo functionality
5. Add support for multiple floors/levels

The implementation is flexible and extensible, making it easy to add more features in the future as requirements evolve.
